#Mobile-Bus-Routing
MBR is an Android app for Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District riders. MBR links the Android calendar to the CUMTD APIs.
With MBR, you can set alarms for events in your calendar and have the app let you know when it's time to get on the bus.
MBR can also plot how to get around town via CUMTD on a map, and can tell you about stops and routes near your current position.

##Documentation
Documentation can be found in MBR-Documentation.pdf in the top-level folder

##Compiling
We wrote MBR using Android Studio. To compile and run MBR, first clone the code from our Github repo: https://github.com/B1indfire/Mobile-Bus-Routing.
Once you have the code, open Android Studio and use the Import Project option on the downloaded code.
Once Android Studio imports the code, you can run it by selecting the "app" run configuration and hitting the "Run" button (shaped like a "play" icon).


If there is no "app" run configuration in the dropdown next to the Run button, you'll have to create one.
Choose the "Edit Configurations" option in that dropdown.
Create a new "Android Application" entry and set its module to "app".
Then run this configuration using the "Run" button on the main screen, as before.


##Installing and Running the App Without Android Studio
MBR can run on any Android device that's running version Lollipop or later. Your Android phone should also have installing from Unknown sources settings enabled.
To run MBR, get the MBR.apk file onto your Android device, then click on it using any file explorer app and choose the "install" option.
MBR can then be launched at any time by clicking on the MBR icon in the "all apps" screen.
As with any app, you can click and drag MBR onto your home screen, which is useful since we're sure you'll want to start it quite often.

The MBR.apk file can be found as an attachment on our main wiki page: https://wiki.cites.illinois.edu/wiki/display/cs428sp16/Mobile+bus+routing?src=breadcrumbs-parent
